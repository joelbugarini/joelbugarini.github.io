A few weeks ago I decided to build a tool for generating code, a tool that help me and others to build software in a faster way. Yeap! It's going to be an excellent tool and it's going to help (hopefully) a lot of people. I though in some basic features and there is no tool like that (or I don't know it), the idea seems pretty solid. I need a proof of concept, some way to determinate if it's possible to build that, a [pretotype][pretotype]. 


So I take my old hammer (C#) and code until 3o'clock, it was finished, a console application with basic functionality. It works pretty well, but I had some doubts about it, just works on Windows with a SQL Server Database, not very open source way of building it. I need other platform for my tool, and learn a good language in the way. I started asking the intern with this question: "What Programming Language should I use?". 


I want to build a command line tool, and it had to be multipltaform (Any desktop OS) to cover a great part of the environments. So *C++* crossed my mind, but something was missing in this picture, it's just translate the core algorithm to C++ and learn how to build a console application in multiples OS. It wasn't the learning experience I was looking for.


Reading a little about the topic I found **Haskell** kind of interesting, a lot of people reviews talks about what a good experience of learning is, and the power it has, it's compared to C++ in maturity but for functional programming. Reading and reading more reviews just convinced me that it's the language and experience I was looking for. So I started reading the good book [learnyouahaskell.com][learnyouahaskell.com], it's pretty friendly and fun to read. There were a lot of concepts to learn: Typeclasses, list comprehension, pattern matching, guards, etc. And the list goes on. It's ok, remember that names shouldn't make things harder, *"Understanding stands over Naming concepts"*.
I've already read half the book and I have nothing to say than all the recommendations was right, it's a pretty amazing language and the learning experience is over power! The build of my tool had to wait but I think it worth the time.


I recommend  (Like almost everyone) to learn Haskell or a functional programming in a functional way.

Hello I have been a software developer for about 10 years and lucky to be paid for that. I dropped out School 10 years ago to start my career as a software developer. I've been in some projects and I built a family in that time. In 2020 I have concluded my bachelor degree and today I can be called an engineer in computer systems.
\
\
I'm passionate about programming and my hobby is woodworking because it is an instant gratification work:  you can see the results of your work in one afternoon. But in programming you can work for days in something that no one will see.
\
\
I think that empathy for others is a very important skill as a software developer and we should be very careful with this topic. It's for that reason that I always advice to listen before talking.

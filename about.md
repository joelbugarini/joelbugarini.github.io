I'm a Software Developer and this few pages are my humble try to give back a little of what others give to me. A few years back in time I've started working as a developer in a small company in Chihuahua, Mexico, and since that moment my life changed a lot.

#Early footsteps

I am from a small town, as you might guess, with small schools, so frequently I used to think that there is something better out there, in other places.  The grass looks greener on the other side of the fence, that’s why I moved from my hometown at 5 semester in college, leaving behind my friends, family and all I know. Not an easy thing to do, my father couldn’t afford it, so I had to get a half time job faster to continue my studies. At this stage of my (non existing) career everything indicate that getting a job in Chihuahua, related to my school studies was nearly to impossible, and sometimes people may said that to me. Well, let me tell you something, I had no knowledge of the city, no contacts, not much knowledge about programming and just a month to get something, still I could get it. 

Two graduate students and me was interviewed for a job, but for some reason I inspire trust on my boss. That’s how I get my first real job as a programmer, what a hard time was that, learning a lot in school and fighting to understand the storm of information that my new job required, a little of UI design in Silverlight, a little of RIA services, and a little of DNN (.Net based CMS).  Six months that I remember as the first steps of my career, ended because my boss received a job offer outside the country, I’m still grateful for the opportunity he gave to me.

Obviously I was under pressure, fortunately I knew how to handle it. So the next vacation I was looking for my next job. A school friend attend to a mobile development course, a head hunter was prowling around and my friend referred me. A short interview later I was working for the company, again a small one, two developers before me left the company due to awful sales contracts. It never bothers me because I was paid weekly, and they allowed me being a half time employee.

I was hired as a Mobile Software Developer, I was in charge of the research for the new Android SDK, just a week or two later I was switched as a Windows Client Developer in WPF, again at UI design. That was a big project for government, and we were a small team, so the development pass to a bigger company in Mexico City, and the company was left as an implementation company. I become a remote developer for the team. 

Since I start working on the project, I had a strange feeling about everything. The time was too short for that project, the team was just giving me foolish tasks, I just hear a lot of excuses for not showing me the code, people were rude to me, so I express myself to my boss and he say that everything was OK. Maybe my in-expertise,  maybe he was so persuasive or maybe I just don’t want troubles, I never know, but I keep making that ball of snow growing. 

Two weeks before the release I fly to Mexico City to get the software and make some tests. I was in a very big city trying to find my team at their office, but they never showed up, for three days I visited the office and they never come. The last day, one of them told me that I could found him in another company, which they were working with. I ran away to make it to the other company, then in the middle of the way I realize that I’ve never saw his face, so had to find someone I don’t know. Fortunately, I am tall and easily recognizable in a crowd, he found me and we move to a restaurant to sit down and transfer the software to my hard drive, that was the first time I saw the software. I come back to the Hotel, get my stuffs and fly back to Chihuahua for the tests, I was about to install it when I realize that the copy was damaged and can’t be used. The next fly was the one to implement the software, all test were cancelled, the very idea of implement a system without any kind of test terrifies me, still I was encouraged to go on with all of this. 

Five days prior the system delivery, I flew again to Mexico City to get another copy, next day I flew to Sonora, Mexico where the system belong, meet the people and they give me access to the server where I should make a release. My company didn’t pay any expert on the topic (infrastructure), so the task was given to me: take a new server and make a complete functional server where the application should run. We are talking about a new SQL Server installation, an Active Directory configuration, Sharepoint installation and some other things that I don’t (want to?) remember. In theory, this isn’t a complex task, but due to my non existing knowledge about any of this technologies I made some mistakes. I ran out of time, law force us to show  the system next day and I have reinstalled the server about three times in the past days. 

So, there I was, calling to Mexico City, asking for guidance, being pressured for my boss in Sonora, and being interrogated for the tech guys of the client. I was installing SQL Server for the _n_ time at 6:00 pm (14 hours for the release), it takes it’s time. More pressure and more complaints were given to me and all I could do was click Next to the installation.

*10:00 pm*
_”10 hours for the release”_  I’ve just finished other installation for the server and guess what… yes! It didn’t work. I needed to reinstall the server and start over the process. The faces of the people when I explain the situation was not a happy face. 

*12:00 pm*
_”8 hours for the release”_  The people around the office was walking around without any thing to do but wait for me. That made me think that the green progress bar was peculiarly slow.

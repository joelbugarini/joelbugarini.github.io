I'm a Software Developer and this few pages are my humble try to give back a little of what others give to me. A few years back in time I've started working as a developer in a small company in Chihuahua, Mexico, and since that moment my life changed a lot.

#Early footsteps

I am from a small town, as you might guess, with small schools for sure, so I used to think that there is something better out there, in other places.  The grass looks greener on the other side of the fence, that’s why I moved from my hometown at 5 semester in college, leaving behind my friends, family and all I know. Not an easy thing to do, my father couldn’t afford it, so I had to get a half time job faster to continue my studies. At this stage of my (non existing) career everything indicate that getting a job in Chihuahua, related to my school studies was nearly to impossible. Well, let me tell you something, I had no knowledge of the city, no contacts, not much knowledge about programming and just a month to get something, still I could get it. 

My first real job as a programmer, what a hard time was that, learning a lot in school and fighting to understand the storm of information that my new job required, a little of UI design in Silverlight, a little of RIA services, and a little of DNN (.Net based CMS).  Six months that I remember as the first steps of my career, ended because my boss received a job offer outside the country.

Obviously I was under pressure, fortunately I knew how to handle it. So the next vacation I was looking for my next job. A school friend attend to a mobile development course and a head hunter was prowling around and my friend referred me. A short interview later I was working for the company, again a small one, the two developers before me left the project for awful sales contracts. It never bothers me because I was paid weekly, and they allowed me being half time employee.

I was hired as a Mobile Software Developer, I was in charge of the research for the new Android SDK, nothing of this happened, a week or two later I was switched as a Windows Client Developer in WPF, again at UI design. That was a huge project for government, and we were a small team, so the development pass to a bigger company in Mexico City, and the company was left as an implementation company. I become a remote developer for the team. 

Since I start working on the project, I had a strange feeling about everything. The time was too short for that project, the team is just giving me foolish tasks, I just hear a lot of excuses for not showing me the code, people were rude to me, so I express myself to my boss and he say that everything was OK. Maybe my in-expertise,  maybe he was so persuasive or maybe I just don’t want troubles, I never know, but I keep making that ball of snow growing. 

Two weeks before the release I fly to Mexico City to get the software and make some tests. I was in a very big city trying to find my team at their office, but they never showed up, for three days I visited the office and they never come. The last day, one of them told me that I could found him in another company, which they were working with. I ran away to make it to the other company, then in the middle of the way I realize that I’ve never saw his face, so had to find someone I don’t know. Fortunately, I am tall and easily recognizable in a crowd, he found me and we move to a restaurant to sit down and transfer the software...

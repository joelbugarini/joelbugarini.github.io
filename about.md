I'm a Software Developer and this few pages are my humble try to give back a little of what others give to me. A few years back in time I've started working as a developer in a small company in Chihuahua, Mexico, and since that moment my life changed a lot.

#Early footsteps

I am from a small town, as you might guess, with small schools, so frequently I used to think that there was something better out there, in other places. The grass looks greener on the other side of the fence, that’s why I moved from my hometown in my 5th semester in college, leaving behind my friends, family and all I know. Not an easy thing to do, my father couldn’t afford it, so I had to get a half time job faster to continue my studies. At this stage of my (non existing) career everything indicates that getting a job in Chihuahua, related to my school studies was nearly to impossible, and sometimes people might have said that to me. Well, let me tell you something, I had no knowledge of the city, no contacts, not much knowledge about programming and just a month to get something, still I could get it.

Two graduate students and me were interviewed for a job, but for some reason I inspired trust on my boss. That’s how I got my first real job as a programmer, what a hard time was that, learning a lot in school and fighting to understand the storm of information that my new job required, a little of UI design in Silverlight, a little of RIA services, and a little of DNN (.Net based CMS). Six months that I remember as the first steps of my career, ended because my boss received a job offer outside the country, I’m still grateful for the opportunity he gave to me.

Obviously I was under pressure, fortunately I knew how to handle it. So the next vacation I was looking for my next job. A school friend attended to a mobile development course, a headhunter was prowling around and my friend referred me. A short interview later I was working for the company, again a small one, two developers before me left the company due to awful sales contracts. It never bothers me because I was paid weekly, and they allowed me being a half time employee.

I was hired as a Mobile Software Developer and I was in charge of the research for the new Android SDK, just a week or two later I was switched as a Windows Client Developer in WPF, again at UI design. That was a big project for the government, and we were a small team, so the development passed to a bigger company in Mexico City, and the company was left as an implementation company. I became a remote developer for the team.

Since I started working on the project, I had a strange feeling about everything. The time was too short for that project, the team was just giving me foolish tasks, I just heard a lot of excuses for not showing me the code and people were rude to me, so I expressed myself to my boss and he said that everything was OK. Maybe my in-expertise, maybe he was so persuasive or maybe I just didn’t wanted any trouble, I never knew, but I keep making that ball of snow growing.

Two weeks before the release I flew to Mexico City to get the software and make some tests. I was in a very big city trying to find my team at their office, but they never showed up, for three days I visited the office and they never came. The last day, one of them told me that I could find him in another company, where they were working. I ran away to make it to the other company, then in the middle of the way I realized that I’ve never seen his face, so I had to find someone I don’t know. Fortunately, I am tall and easily recognizable in a crowd, he found me and we moved to a restaurant to sit down and transfer the software to my hard drive, that was the first time I saw the software. I came back to the Hotel, got my stuff and flew back to Chihuahua for the tests, I was about to install it when I realized that the copy was damaged and couldn’t be used. The next fly was the one to implement the software, all test were cancelled, the very idea of implement a system without any kind of test terrifies me, and still I was encouraged to go on with all of this.

Five days prior the system delivery, I flew again to Mexico City to get another copy, next day I flew to Sonora, Mexico where the system belongs, meet the people and they gave me access to the server where I should make a release. My company didn’t pay any expert on the topic (infrastructure), so the task was given to me: take a new server and make a complete functional server where the application should run. We are talking about a new SQL Server installation, an Active Directory configuration, SharePoint installation and some other things that I don’t (want to?) remember. In theory, this isn’t a complex task, but due to my non-existing knowledge about any of this technologies I made some mistakes. I ran out of time, law forced us to show the system next day and I have reinstalled the server about three times in the past days.

So, there I was, calling to Mexico City, asking for guidance, being pressured by my boss in Sonora, and being interrogated by the tech guys of the client. I was installing SQL Server for the n time at 6:00 pm (14 hours for the release), it takes its time. More pressure and more complaints were given to me and all I could do was click Next to the installation.


*10:00 pm*
_”10 hours for the release”_  I’ve just finished other installation for the server and guess what… yes! It didn’t work. I needed to reinstall the server and start over the process. The faces of the people when I explained the situation were not exactly a happy face.

*12:00 am*
_”8 hours for the release”_  The people around the office were walking around without anything to do but wait for me. That made me think that the green progress bar was peculiarly slow.

*2:00 am*
_”6 hours for the release”_  Chaos, a very accurate word for the situation. Confusion everywhere, no one believed what was happening and I was in the middle of this battle, fighting to make that thing work. All the people involved in this project were trying to help, they took some PC´s and started installing Windows Server on them, useless at this point.

*4:00 am*
_”4 hours for the release”_ The image of my boss sitting on a chair, laying on his knees, grabbing his hair with his hands spoke by itself. Things went very wrong, so I stopped trying to make another installation, stood up from my chair, walked to the team and said:

- What do you need to show today?
- Just a window where they could see the PDF’s for today. -The boss of the project said, and I immediately remembered I had some PSD files from the Designer that I could easily import through a feature of Blend.
- I can make it in two hours, you take a shower, take a nap and come back to help me install it in each PC.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am -I wasn’t, but for some reason I said that.
    
Everyone ran to their houses, I was alone importing a PSD file to a recently created project, hard coding like never before, turning images into buttons without states. Two hours later I was done, a pretty convincing screen where people could read a document. People came over to help me install it in every machine and we presented it that way. The meeting didn’t last more than 20 minutes, nobody said anything. I was petrified, waiting for the worst when a user said:

- Are you the programmer?
- Y..Yes -I answered with a lump in the throat.
- Is it possible to swipe the document instead of using the scroll bar? Just like an iPad.
- Of course! -I said with a smile in the face.
    
Nobody noticed, a very good sense of relief came to my body, and I could breath again. After all this nightmare we were taken to a boardroom where they yelled at us, I didn’t care at all, I was dead like a ghost and to me that was a battle won.
